## Typing Test Analysis
### About
[MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com) is a customizable typing test website that allows the user to download 
their typing data. To me, this presents itself as a perfect candidate for a data analysis project! Over the course 
of the last few years, I have added data points to my account by completing typing tests across various different modes
and several languages.

In this project, I have created data visualizations of these data points. I have stuck to exploratory data analysis 
techniques, with using plots that represent the statistics of the data, such as a box and whisker plot, as well as 
pie charts to represent distributions of features.

**Some helpful notes:**  
- The `time` mode represents a timed test, in seconds.  
- The `words` mode is a test that consists of typing a sequence of words, either 10, 25, 50, or 100.  
- The `quote` mode involves typing a specific quote.
