# Typing Test Analysis
### About
[MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com) is a customizable typing test website that allows the user to download 
their typing data. To me, this presents itself as a perfect candidate for a data analysis project! Over the course 
of the last few years, I have added data points to my account by completing typing tests across various different modes
and several languages.

In this project, I have created data visualizations of these data points. I have stuck to exploratory data analysis 
techniques, with using plots that represent the statistics of the data, such as a box and whisker plot, as well as 
pie charts to represent distributions of features.
